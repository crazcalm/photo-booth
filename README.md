# photo-booth
I am finally starting on the photo booth project that I promised Dave.

##Python Version:
* 3.2.3
    * That is the default python 3 on my raspberry pi.
    * I am trying to install python 3.4.3. If that works, then
      I will switch 

##Needs:
* Camera class wrapper
* GUI
    * Camera section
    * Button section
    * Camera Preview overlay has to move with the canvas
    
## Plan (for hackathon):
    - Build simple version of GUI first
    - Add camera class later
    - If I cannot get the preview and the GUI to move at the same time, oh well.
    
## GUI motivation:
    - Mac Photo booth: I would love to recreate their design using tkinter!
